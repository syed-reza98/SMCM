   cd SMCM
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Using Docker (recommended)
   docker-compose up -d db redis
   
   # Or install PostgreSQL and Redis locally
   # Create database and run migrations
   cd backend
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using Docker Compose (recommended)
   docker-compose up
   
   # Option 2: Manual startup
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 3 - Celery Worker
   cd backend
   celery -A smcm worker --loglevel=info
   ```

### Docker Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SMCM.git
cd SMCM

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000
# Admin Panel: http://localhost:8000/admin
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Follow coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd backend
   python manage.py test
   pytest
   
   # Frontend tests
   cd frontend
   npm test
   
   # Linting
   cd backend
   flake8 .
   black .
   isort .
   
   cd frontend
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```
   
   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `style:` for formatting changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for adding tests
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

5. **Push and create a Pull Request**

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Pull Request Requirements**
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - All tests must pass
   - Code review approval required

## Issue Reporting

When reporting issues, please include:

- **Clear title** that summarizes the problem
- **Environment details** (OS, browser, Python/Node versions)
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Screenshots** if applicable
- **Error messages** or logs

### Issue Templates

Use these labels for different types of issues:

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or improvement
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Maximum line length: 88 characters

```python
# Example
def create_campaign(
    user: User,
    title: str,
    platforms: List[str],
    schedule_date: datetime
) -> Campaign:
    """Create a new social media campaign.
    
    Args:
        user: The user creating the campaign
        title: Campaign title
        platforms: List of social media platforms
        schedule_date: When to publish the campaign
        
    Returns:
        Created Campaign instance
    """
    pass
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend)

- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Write meaningful component and variable names

```typescript
// Example
interface CampaignProps {
  campaign: Campaign;
  onEdit: (id: string) => void;
}

const CampaignCard: React.FC<CampaignProps> = ({ campaign, onEdit }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing

- Write unit tests for models, views, and utilities
- Use Django's TestCase or pytest
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Test both success and error cases

```python
# Example test
class CampaignModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_campaign_creation(self):
        campaign = Campaign.objects.create(
            title="Test Campaign",
            user=self.user
        )
        self.assertEqual(campaign.title, "Test Campaign")
```

### Frontend Testing

- Write unit tests for components and utilities
- Use React Testing Library
- Test user interactions and edge cases
- Write integration tests for critical flows

```typescript
// Example test
test('renders campaign title', () => {
  render(<CampaignCard campaign={mockCampaign} onEdit={jest.fn()} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Test Campaign')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
